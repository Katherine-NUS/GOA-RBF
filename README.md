# Surrogate Optimization Algorithms for Expensive Global Optimization Problems
This repository is an optimization toolbox for computationally expensive global optimization problems. This toolbox supports multiple surrogate optimization softwares including: Python Surrogate Optimization Toolbox ([pySOT](https://github.com/dme65/pySOT)), Gap Optimized Multi-objective Optimization using Response Surfaces ([GOMORS](https://github.com/drkupi/GOMORS_pySOT)), ùúÄ-dominance Many-objective Surrogate-assisted Optimization(ùúÄ-MaSO) and Global Optimization in Parallel with Surrogate ([GOPS](https://github.com/louisXW/GOPS)). All optimization algorithms can be used in serial, synchronous parallel, and asynchronous parallel and we support both continuous and integer variables.<br>
## Installation
The easiest way to install pySOT2 is through pip in which case the following command should suffice:
```
pip install pySOT2
```
## Running pySOT2
This repository aims to provide fast implementation of optimization algorithms, in the meantime, it also provides many parameters so users can easily adjust the algorithms accordingly. To run this repository, users can first define the optimzation problems and choose an optimizor which will return the best solutions and its corresponding function value.The "examples" folder provide sample codes for all the softwares included.<br>
1. For single objective optimization problems, DYCORS(in pySOT) is recommended:
 ```
from pySOT2.Optimize import Optim
Optim.optimize(problem)
```
2. For multi-objective optimization problems, GOMORS is recommended:
```
from pySOT2.Optimize import MOoptim
MOoptim.MOoptimize(problem)
```
3. For many-objective(more than 3) optimization problems, ùúÄ-MaSO is recommended:
```
from pySOT2.Optimize import epsMOoptim
epsMOoptim.epsMOoptimize(problem)
```
4. For parallel optimization on high dimensional problems, GOPS is recommended:
```
from pySOT2.Optimize import GOPSoptim
GOPSoptim.GOPSoptimize(problem)
```
