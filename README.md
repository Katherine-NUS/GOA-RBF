# Surrogate Optimization Algorithms for Expensive Global Optimization Problems
This repository is an optimization toolbox for computationally expensive global optimization problems. This toolbox supports multiple surrogate optimization softwares including: Python Surrogate Optimization Toolbox (pySOT), Gap Optimized Multi-objective Optimization using Response Surfaces (GOMORS), ùúÄ-dominance Many-objective Surrogate-assisted Optimization(ùúÄ-MaSO) and Global Optimization in Parallel with Surrogate (GOPS). All optimization algorithms can be used in serial, synchronous parallel, and asynchronous parallel and we support both continuous and integer variables.
